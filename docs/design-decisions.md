# Design decisions & hard-won fixes

A running log of non-obvious problems this project has hit and how they were
solved — the *why* behind choices that aren't self-evident from the code, and
the dead ends that were ruled out. Read this before re-litigating a design or
"simplifying" something that looks odd; it's probably odd on purpose.

> **Maintenance rule:** whenever you solve a new non-obvious problem (a bug whose
> cause was surprising, a workaround for an external tool, a design fork with a
> rejected alternative), **add an entry here** in the same Problem → Cause →
> Fix → Alternatives-rejected shape. Keep the canonical architecture in
> [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md); this file is the *reasoning* and *history*.

Each entry: **Symptom** (what you'd observe), **Cause** (root cause, ideally
with evidence), **Fix** (what we did), **Rejected** (what we tried or considered
and why it lost).

## GNOME apps (eog, evince) take ~33s to start in the X11 Launcher

- **Symptom:** Launching a GTK/GNOME app (eog, evince) from the X11 Launcher on
  the Apps display showed a blank canvas for ~33s before the window appeared;
  Firefox/Chromium/native apps (xterm) were instant.
- **Cause:** The Apps display (`:98`) is a bare `xpra start-desktop` + matchbox
  session — **no GNOME session**. GNOME services like `xdg-desktop-portal` are
  *activatable but hang* there (their backends wait for a session that doesn't
  exist). GTK apps query the portal on startup and block the **25-second D-Bus
  method-call timeout**. Evidence: `strace` showed eog threads each blocking in
  `poll()` for exactly ~25.0s on D-Bus fds; a direct probe of
  `org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop` activation timed at exactly 25.0s while
  gvfs/dconf/a11y returned in 0.0s.
- **Fix:** Run launcher apps against a **private D-Bus session with no service
  activation** (`vibetop-apps-dbus`, a `dbus-daemon` with no `<servicedir>`,
  socket `/run/user/<uid>/vibetop-apps-bus`). On it, those service calls fail
  fast (ServiceUnknown) instead of hanging → eog starts in ~0.2s. The bus is
  chosen **per app**: snap apps (Firefox/Chromium, detected via `/snap/bin/<prog>`)
  get the **real user bus** instead, because they *exit* on a bare bus (snap
  confinement needs the session bus) and never block on the portal anyway.
- **Rejected:**
  - `GTK_USE_PORTAL=0` (per-app env): it *did* stop portal activation, but eog
    was still ~33s — there was a second hanging service too. Whack-a-mole.
  - Pointing **terminal** shells at the private bus as well: breaks
    `systemctl --user`/`gsettings` (they need the real user bus). So terminals
    keep the user bus; only the launcher routes to the private bus.
  - Masking `xdg-desktop-portal` globally: would affect a physical GNOME login
    on the host (if any). The private bus is isolated to launcher apps.

## Snap apps (Firefox/Chromium) won't open the Apps display

- **Symptom:** `firefox` from the launcher did nothing; log showed
  `Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified` /
  `cannot open display :98`. Native apps (xterm) and `wmctrl` worked fine.
- **Cause:** Snap confinement — a confined snap launched *outside* xpra's own
  process can't read the X authority cookie, so the X server rejects it. Native
  same-user clients connect fine.
- **Fix:** `xhost +local:` at Apps-display startup (a `--start` in
  `vibetop-apps-xpra.service`) disables X access control for local clients. Safe:
  the display is loopback-only and the host is single-user behind Access.
  `x11-xserver-utils` (provides `xhost`) is an apt dep.

## Browser must stay its own app, but Apps needs its own canvas

- **Symptom:** Wanting a tabbed "launch GUI apps" experience *and* keeping the
  Browser (Chromium) as a separate app.
- **Cause:** One xpra display can only present **one canvas**. Chromium and any
  launched app share a single display, so two canvas iframes of the same display
  fight over size (a hidden iframe measures 0×0 and shrinks the display) — the
  same reason multi-device window mirroring was dropped.
- **Fix:** A **second xpra display** (`:98`, `vibetop-apps-xpra`, matchbox, no
  Chromium) dedicated to launched apps, proxied at `/apps-display/`. The Browser
  keeps `:99`. The X11 Launcher (`apps.html`) embeds the `:98` canvas with a tab
  bar; the two displays never conflict.
- **Rejected:** Merging Chromium into one tabbed "Desktop" (user wanted Browser
  separate); embedding a second canvas of `:99` in the launcher (size conflict).

## X11 apps launched from a Terminal should appear in the launcher

- **Symptom:** Running `gnuplot` (or any GUI app) in a Terminal had nowhere to
  render.
- **Fix:** `vibetop-session@.service` exports `DISPLAY=:98` +
  `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` + `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, so terminal-started GUI apps
  render on the Apps desktop and show up as tabs. The desktop also polls
  `/api/x/windows` and auto-opens the X11 Launcher when a new window appears.
  (`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` silences/fixes Qt apps like gnuplot's qt terminal.)
  Note: this is a systemd-unit change — it only lands on a full deploy /
  `terminal/install.sh`, and only for **newly started** sessions.

## eog/evince single-instance hand-off

- **Symptom:** Launching eog a second time opened no new window; A/B timing
  tests gave nonsense ("NONE") results.
- **Cause:** GNOME apps are **GApplication single-instance** — a second launch
  hands off to the running primary (and with no file, opens nothing). It also
  made repeated benchmarking unreliable until the `org.gnome.eog` bus name was
  confirmed released between runs.
- **Fix / note:** Not "fixed" (it's expected GNOME behavior) — documented so the
  launcher's "nothing happened" isn't mistaken for a bug, and so future
  measurements force a clean primary instance.

## `@BASE_PORT@` left unsubstituted in the ttyd unit (latent install bug)

- **Symptom:** A *fresh* install would render `Environment=BASE_PORT=@BASE_PORT@`
  in `vibetop-ttyd@.service`; `ttyd-run.sh`'s `$(( @BASE_PORT@ + N ))` is a
  syntax error → ttyd never binds → terminals fail.
- **Cause:** The unit-render loop in `terminal/install.sh` only substituted
  `@APP_USER@`/`@APP_DIR@`, not `@BASE_PORT@`. Masked on existing hosts because
  the in-app Update runs `install.sh` with `INSTALL_SYSTEMD=0` (doesn't re-render
  units), so they keep their old correctly-rendered files.
- **Fix:** Added `@BASE_PORT@` (and the new `@APPS_DISPLAY@`/`@APP_UID@`) to the
  loop's `sed`.

## Tabs in the Files app (multiple folders)

- **Goal:** view several folders at once, switching tabs instead of navigating
  back and forth.
- **Approach:** FileBrowser is a single-folder SPA, so the Files app is now a
  wrapper (`files.html`) hosting **one FileBrowser iframe per tab** (like the
  Terminal tabs), kept alive so switching is instant and preserves each folder's
  state. Tab labels are the live folder name, read from each iframe's
  `contentWindow.location` (same-origin). Open paths persist in `localStorage`.
- **Gotcha — the location-memory patch fought the tabs:** `filebrowser-patches.js`
  has a single-key "restore last folder" that `location.replace`s any `/files/`
  root load to the saved path — which would yank *every* tab to one folder. Fix:
  the wrapper names each iframe `fbtab` (survives the SPA's in-iframe nav), and
  the patch skips its location-memory when `window.name === "fbtab"` (the wrapper
  owns path memory). The SW BYPASS token was tightened from `files` to `files/`
  so the wrapper page `/files.html` is cacheable while the live SPA at `/files/*`
  stays network-only.
- **Deep links:** the Upload app's "Open in Files" used to overwrite the Files
  iframe `src` (would destroy the tabs); now the desktop posts a `files-open-tab`
  message (a few times, to beat the first-load race; the wrapper dedupes) and the
  wrapper opens a tab at that path.

## Auto-refresh every client on deploy (SSE push)

- **Goal:** after a deploy, every connected client should land on the new shell
  on its own — so fixes/features (e.g. the cross-device close) aren't defeated by
  a device sitting on a stale cached shell, with no per-app refresh logic.
- **Mechanism:** the manager serves an **SSE stream `GET /api/events`** that
  watches the deployed `sw.js` VERSION and pushes a `reload` event when it changes.
  The client (EventSource) responds by calling `registration.update()`; the new
  service worker takes control → `controllerchange` → a **full
  `window.location.reload()`** of the whole desktop (one reload re-loads every app
  iframe too — thorough, no per-app code). Guarded by `hadController` so the first
  install doesn't reload mid-load.
- **Why SSE, not polling:** first built as `registration.update()` polling
  (~90s + on focus). The user (rightly) wanted push to avoid wasted polling. SSE
  fits the threaded `http.server` (one held thread per client), needs **no nginx
  change** (`X-Accel-Buffering: no` disables response buffering; ~18s pings keep
  nginx/Cloudflare from idling the stream out and detect a dead client), and one
  server-side version-check replaces N client polls.
- **The reliability gap (and fix) — learned the hard way:** the naïve SSE only
  notices a version change *while a connection is live*. A tab that's
  disconnected at deploy time (manager restart, network blip, or a **backgrounded
  tab whose stream the browser suspended**) reconnects, baselines to the
  now-current version, and **never learns it should reload** → stale forever. This
  is exactly the case where stateless polling is more reliable. Fix that keeps the
  push: the client remembers the version from its **first `hello`**, and on every
  reconnect compares — if the server's version differs, it **self-heals** (reloads)
  the moment it reconnects or is brought to the foreground. Plus a second client
  bug: the reload was driven by `controllerchange`, which an **uncontrolled** page
  (after a hard reload, `hadController=false`) never fires — so on an explicit
  `reload`/version-mismatch the client now reloads **directly** (`doSwReload`), not
  via `controllerchange`. A tab-focus `registration.update()` remains as a last
  fallback. (`/api/events` logs `[events] pushed reload v…->v…` so a deploy
  propagating is visible in the journal.)
- **Why a full reload (not gentle/deferred):** a thorough refresh is intended —
  persistent state survives the reload (terminals/Browser reconnect, notes
  autosave, Files/Notes tabs are server-side), so the brief blip is acceptable and
  guarantees consistency.
- **Bootstrap:** a client must already run the auto-refresh build for this to
  fire; pre-existing open tabs need one manual reload to get onto it.

## Close an app on all devices

- **Problem:** windows are per-instance (opening on one device doesn't open on
  another — deliberate), and closing was local-only, so an app left open on
  device A couldn't be closed from device B; its Start-menu union dot stayed green.
- **Mechanism:** `POST /api/desktop/close {app}` records the **live instances that
  currently have the app open** in `close_targets` (`{appId:[instanceId,…]}`).
  Each instance closes the app when it sees its own id in a heartbeat reply, then
  reports an open-set without it and the server prunes it (also pruned when stale).
  - *First tried* a per-app counter (`close_ops`) with clients baselining the seen
    value on load. **Rejected after hitting it live:** a device that held the app
    on a *stale shell* during the close didn't act, and after reloading it
    *baselined* the existing counter and still wouldn't close — so the app stayed
    stuck. Targeting by instance id fixes both: reloading the holder (same
    `INSTANCE_ID`) still closes it, and a stuck holder can't poison the app for
    other devices (a global flag would).
- **UX (why a visible Start-menu button, not the alternatives):** the close
  affordance lives as a **✕ button on the Start-menu row, shown only when the app
  is running**, with a **confirm**. Rejected: a window-corner overlay button
  (apps fill the pane with their own top toolbars → it'd cover their controls, and
  it can't reach an app open only on another device); a tiny inline ✕ (hard to hit
  / easy to mis-tap); a hidden long-press/right-click (invisible and finicky on
  touch). A real tap-target + confirm addresses both "hard to click" and "easy to
  mis-click," and the Start menu is the one surface that lists apps open on *other*
  devices. The taskbar × stays local ("close here").

## Tabs in the Notes app (multiple, renameable notes)

- **Goal:** multiple notes with tabs, renameable like the Terminal tabs.
- **Approach:** Notes went from a single file + single-doc API to **multi-document,
  server-side**: each note is `~/.local/share/desktop-notes/<id>.md`, the tab index
  (`{tabs:[{id,name}], active}`) is `index.json` in that dir — server-side so
  names/order/active propagate across devices (like terminal tab names). API:
  `GET /api/notes` (index), `GET /api/notes?id=` (content), `POST /api/notes
  {id,content}` (save), `POST /api/notes/tabs {tabs,active}` (the client owns the
  tab list; the manager stores it and deletes files for closed tabs).
- **Data safety:** note ids are sanitized (`_safe_note_id`, `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`)
  so an id can only ever be a plain filename inside the notes dir (no `../`
  traversal). The **legacy single-note file** (`desktop-notes.md`) is migrated into
  tab `"1"` on first use and **left intact** (not deleted) as a safety net.
  Closing a tab deletes its note file, so the frontend **confirms** before closing
  a non-empty note. Verified end-to-end (migration, create/save/read, close-deletes,
  traversal-id rejection).
- **Rejected:** keeping closed-note files as orphans (avoids accidental loss but
  accumulates dead files) — chose delete-on-close + a frontend confirm instead.

## Launcher "spins forever" on a not-installed / mistyped command

- **Symptom:** Typing a command that isn't installed (e.g. `gimp` when it's not
  on the host) left the progress bar spinning indefinitely — looked like a slow
  load, but nothing was ever going to appear.
- **Cause:** `/api/x/launch` returned `{ok:true}` the instant it spawned the
  `su -c` shell; it had no idea the command then failed (`command not found`,
  exit 127), so the window-poll never cleared the bar.
- **Fix:** After spawning, the manager does a short `proc.wait(timeout=3)`. A
  missing/mistyped command exits fast with non-zero (127 = not found) → return a
  `400` with "‘<prog>’ didn't start (exit 127) — not found / not installed?"; a
  real GUI app is still running at 3s → return ok and reap it in the background.
  The launcher shows it as a friendly message ("‘gimp’ isn't installed (or not
  in PATH).") with a Dismiss, not a spinning bar.
  The 3s only delays the *response* on the rare failure path — success still
  shows its window via the poll, independent of the response.
- **Note:** No precheck (`command -v`) — that risked false negatives (aliases,
  custom PATH) blocking valid launches. Watching the actual exit is accurate.

## Slow app launch looked broken (blank canvas)

- **Symptom:** After hitting Run, the canvas was blank for seconds (esp. cold
  GNOME apps) and looked frozen.
- **Fix:** An indeterminate **progress bar** overlay in `apps.html` ("Launching
  `<cmd>`…") shown until the window appears, with a "still starting / may have
  failed" hint after 25s and a Dismiss. (Largely moot now that the portal fix
  makes GNOME apps fast, but it still covers genuinely slow first launches.)

## No server-side logs made debugging slow ("limited logs on the server side")

- **Symptom:** Several hard bugs this cycle (eog portal hang, snap firefox not
  launching, an instance stuck not auto-refreshing) were diagnosed almost blind —
  `terminal-manager.py` did its work silently. `log_message` was a bare `pass`
  (HTTP access lines suppressed) and the only prints were a handful of `[office]`
  stderr lines, so the journal carried almost nothing about what the manager did
  or why a request failed.
- **Fix:** A single `logging` logger (`vibetop`) set up at import
  (`_setup_logging`): a `StreamHandler` to stderr (→ journald, which stamps the
  time) **and** a `RotatingFileHandler` at `/var/log/vibetop/manager.log`. Level
  is `INFO` by default, `LOG_LEVEL` env overrides. Selective, not chatty — INFO
  on the actions that matter (terminal start/stop, `x/launch` with which bus,
  cross-device close, reset summary, update outcome, SSE reload push) and WARNING
  on failures (office callback/forcesave/save-back, launch fast-fail, status
  collection error, update pull failure). The noisy per-request HTTP access log is
  routed to `log.debug`, so it's off at INFO but available via `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`.
- **Self-cleaning:** `RotatingFileHandler(maxBytes=2_000_000, backupCount=5)` caps
  the on-disk log at ~12 MB total (1 active + 5 rotated) and rotates in place — no
  cron/logrotate needed, so it can't grow unbounded. journald applies its own
  retention to the stderr copy. The dir is created on first run; if `/var/log`
  isn't writable the handler is skipped (journal-only) rather than crashing.
- **Shadowing gotcha:** `_handle_update` had a local `log = []` (its step list)
  that shadowed the module logger; renamed to `steps` so `log.*` in that method
  reaches the logger.
- **Rejected:** print-to-stderr only (no file, no levels — can't dial verbosity,
  and journald-only loses the easy `tail -f` a file gives); a verbose access log
  at INFO (drowns the signal — kept at DEBUG); external logrotate (the rotating
  handler is self-contained and needs no host config).

## Killing the terminal "shake" silently broke the double-click/tap re-claim

- **Symptom:** Double-click (desktop) / double-tap (touch) on a terminal used to
  re-claim the shared PTY's shape for this device. After the fix that stopped the
  content from "shaking" on double-click, the gesture stopped reshaping anything —
  no shake, but no re-claim either.
- **Cause:** The shake came from `claimSize()` resizing the *visible xterm grid*
  (`term.resize(c, r-1); term.resize(c, r)`) — the rows jump. The shake-fix sent
  the resize straight to ttyd's WebSocket instead (no grid resize), but sent the
  **current** dims `{columns:c, rows:r}` — exactly the size this client's ttyd PTY
  was **already** at. ttyd dutifully calls `TIOCSWINSZ(c,r)`, but the **kernel
  raises SIGWINCH only when the winsize actually changes**, so no SIGWINCH fired —
  and SIGWINCH is the whole propagation chain: `vibetop-session attach`'s SIGWINCH
  handler (`send_resize`, line ~439) writes the size + SIGUSR1s the serve daemon,
  which `TIOCSWINSZ`es the *shared* bash PTY and SIGWINCHes the shell. No SIGWINCH
  ⇒ nothing propagates ⇒ silent no-op. The old visible nudge worked precisely
  because `r-1 ≠ r` forced two real size changes (two SIGWINCHes).
- **Fix:** Keep sending straight to the socket (so the visible grid never resizes
  → no shake), but **nudge over the socket**: send a neighbour size and back. Two
  genuine size changes → two SIGWINCHes → the shared PTY ends up at this device's
  shape, all without touching the visible xterm grid. Same trick as the original,
  one layer lower.
- **Residual shake (the nudge's intermediate frame), fixed in two parts:** the
  nudge's *first* size still streams a redraw back to this device. (1) **Nudge the
  COLUMN, not the row** (`{c-1,r}` then `{c,r}`): a row nudge makes a bottom-anchored
  TUI (prompt/input box) bounce up a row and back — very visible; a column nudge
  keeps every row in place, so the blip is one column of width for one frame. (2)
  **Debounce the resize in the `vibetop-session` serve daemon** (`RESIZE_DEBOUNCE`
  ~35ms): SIGUSR1 no longer applies the resize inline — it arms a deadline and the
  main loop applies the *latest* saved size once the burst settles, collapsing the
  nudge's two rapid resizes into a single `TIOCSWINSZ` + SIGWINCH. So the shell
  redraws **once, at the final size** — the intermediate frame never reaches it.
  This is what made the shake intermittent ("once every few double-clicks"): the
  two SIGWINCHes sometimes coalesced in the shell and sometimes didn't; the
  debounce makes the single-redraw outcome deterministic. (Daemon change ⇒ only
  **new** sessions get it — the serve daemons are never restarted, since that would
  kill live shells; existing terminals get the column-nudge mitigation until
  reopened.)
- **Rejected:** sending `c×r` once (the regression — same size, no SIGWINCH);
  a row nudge (visible vertical bounce — switched to a column nudge); a magic
  input-escape to re-assert size without a nudge (could collide with real
  input/paste). The column nudge + daemon debounce together cover both the
  re-claim correctness and the residual shake with minimal surface area.

## "Random characters" appear at the prompt (`2RR0;276;0c10;rgb:…$y`)

- **Symptom:** An idle terminal periodically shows bursts of garbage the user
  never typed, e.g. `…$ 2RR0;276;0c10;rgb:d2d2/d2d2/d2d211;rgb:2b2b/2b2b/2b2b12;2$y`
  repeated several times after the prompt. Harmless (Enter clears it) but noisy.
- **Cause:** These are terminal **query *responses***, not random bytes — decode
  to a Cursor-Position Report, Secondary Device Attributes (`…;276;…c`), OSC 10/11
  foreground/background color replies, and a DECRPM mode report. Some program
  (a prompt hook, a bg-color-sniffing tool, a TUI — often re-firing on `SIGWINCH`,
  which vibetop generates a lot via the resize/reshape machinery) writes a
  capability **probe** to the PTY. That probe is PTY *output*, so it lands in
  `vibetop-session`'s ring buffer. Two shared-session mechanisms then turn one
  probe into repeated garbage: (1) **broadcast** — the live PTY stream fans out to
  *every* attached xterm.js client, so each connected browser/tab/device answers
  the same probe, and all answers are written back into the *one* shared PTY and
  echoed at the prompt; (2) **replay** — `vibetop-session` replays its ring buffer
  to each freshly (re)connected client to restore the screen, and vibetop
  reconnects often (mobile suspend/resume, the reconnect guard). A probe sitting in
  the ring gets **re-sent to every reconnecting xterm, which re-answers it** — so
  one stale probe produces a fresh burst on every reconnect. (1) adds one copy per
  extra live client; (2) is what makes it *recurring*.
- **Fix:** Strip terminal query-**request** sequences (DA `…c`, DSR/CPR `…n`,
  DECRQM `…$p`, OSC color/palette `…;?…`) from the ring-buffer **replay only**
  (`strip_terminal_queries` in `vibetop-session`, applied where a new client is
  sent `ring.read_all()`). The **live** broadcast path is untouched — a real probe
  still reaches clients and is answered once, which is correct; only *replayed*
  (stale) probes are dropped, so a reconnect never re-answers. Color/cursor *set*
  sequences (real screen state, e.g. `OSC 11;rgb:…` with no `?`, and a window
  title that merely *contains* a `?`) are deliberately preserved. Pure function,
  unit-tested in `terminal/tests/test_claude_session.py` (strip-vs-preserve table).
- **Rejected:** stripping queries from what's *stored* in the ring (a probe split
  across two `os.read()` chunks could be written non-contiguously — strip at replay
  time instead, where `read_all()` is one contiguous snapshot); de-duplicating the
  near-simultaneous responses from multiple **live** clients in the serve daemon
  (timing-fragile, and the per-extra-client duplication is minor and non-recurring
  — usually 1–2 clients); fixing it shell-side (can't, the emitter is arbitrary
  user software). Daemon change ⇒ only **new** sessions get it (serve daemons are
  never restarted — that would kill live shells); existing terminals stop on the
  next fresh session.

## macOS "error beep" when copying in a terminal (Cmd+C)

- **Symptom:** On macOS, pressing Cmd+C in a terminal plays the system error
  sound (NSBeep) — even when the copy itself works.
- **Cause:** Two things compounded. (1) xterm.js's selection is **not** a DOM
  selection (it paints to a canvas), so when the native Cmd+C key-equivalent
  reaches the browser it finds nothing selected to copy and macOS beeps. (2) The
  copy handler (the `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` injected via the `/tN/`
  `sub_filter`) returned `false` to "consume" Cmd+C — but **returning `false`
  from an xterm custom key handler does NOT call `preventDefault()`**: xterm's
  `_keyDown` returns early *before* its internal `_cancel()` (which is what
  preventDefaults). So the native Cmd+C still fired → beep. The no-selection case
  was worse: the handler fell through to `return true`, never even trying to
  consume it.
- **Fix:** Call `e.preventDefault()` **explicitly** on the copy chord (don't rely
  on `return false`). The handler now: with a selection → `copySelection()` +
  `preventDefault()` + `return false` (no native copy to clobber it or beep);
  Cmd+C with no selection on macOS → `preventDefault()` + `return false` (swallow
  it — Cmd never means SIGINT). The **non-Mac `Ctrl+C` with no selection still
  returns `true`** so it passes through as SIGINT (the interrupt must survive).
- **Rejected:** relying on `return false` alone (the original bug — doesn't
  preventDefault); mirroring the xterm selection into a hidden DOM selection so
  the native copy has something to grab (more moving parts than just
  preventDefaulting and doing our own `execCommand('copy')`). Lives in the
  `sub_filter` (inline, no-store on `/tN/`), so it ships on the next
  `terminal/install.sh` / in-app Update + nginx reload — no cache-bust needed.

## Closing a tab killed detached processes (ssh ControlPersist, tmux, nohup)

- **Symptom:** With `ControlMaster auto` / `ControlPersist`, an ssh connection
  re-authenticated every time — closing the terminal you'd `ssh`'d from dropped
  the persistent master, so the next connection re-prompted. Same for `tmux`,
  `nohup`, and disowned jobs: things that survive closing a *normal* terminal got
  killed when a vibetop tab closed.
- **Cause:** A vibetop terminal is a systemd unit (`vibetop-session@N`). Closing
  a tab does `systemctl stop`, and the default **`KillMode=control-group`** SIGKILLs
  *every* process in the unit's cgroup. A normal terminal close only sends SIGHUP
  to the foreground session — daemonized processes (ssh's `ControlPersist` master
  `setsid`s itself, as do tmux servers and `nohup`/disowned jobs) escape that and
  live on. vibetop's cgroup-kill was strictly more aggressive, so it killed the
  very processes the user detached *on purpose*.
- **Fix:** Set **`KillMode=process`** on `vibetop-session@.service`, so a tab-close
  `stop` signals only the serve daemon (the unit's main process). When it exits it
  closes the PTY master; the kernel hangs up the foreground shell (SIGHUP), bash
  forwards SIGHUP to its jobs and exits, and `setsid`'d daemons survive — exactly
  like closing a real terminal. The serve daemon's SIGTERM handler also now sends
  the shell **SIGHUP** (not SIGTERM, which interactive bash ignores) for an
  immediate, explicit hangup. **Logout/reset still wipes everything:** `_handle_reset`
  now `systemctl kill --kill-whom=all --signal=SIGKILL`s the cgroups *before*
  stopping (that hits every process regardless of `KillMode`), so "clean slate on
  logout" is preserved — only single-tab-close is gentle.
- **Tradeoff (accepted):** closing a tab no longer guarantees zero leftover
  processes — a stuck/SIGHUP-trapping background process now lingers until logout
  or reboot, the same way it would on any real terminal. This is the cost of
  matching normal-terminal semantics; logout/reboot remain the hard reset.
- **Rejected:** a `~/.bashrc` `ssh` wrapper that runs the master in a transient
  `systemd-run --user` scope (works, but pushes the fix onto every user and only
  covers interactive ssh — should be solved once, server-side); `KillMode=mixed`
  (still SIGKILLs the whole cgroup at the end — no better than control-group for
  this); leaving it and documenting the wrapper (the platform should behave like a
  terminal, not require per-user setup). **Deploy:** unit change ⇒ needs a full
  `terminal/install.sh` (systemd) + `daemon-reload`, *not* the in-app Updater (it
  skips units); after daemon-reload even existing terminals stop gently. The
  serve-daemon SIGHUP tweak only affects *new* sessions (daemons aren't restarted),
  but `KillMode=process` alone already does the job via the kernel PTY hangup.

## Root manager service is only *partially* sandboxed (on purpose)

- **Symptom:** A code review flagged that `vibetop-manager.service` runs as root
  with **zero** systemd hardening while the unprivileged child units (session,
  browser-xpra) carry `ProtectKernel*`/`ProtectControlGroups` — backwards on its
  face.
- **Cause:** The manager genuinely needs broad power: it drives `systemctl`,
  drops to `APP_USER` via `su`/`sudo` (both **setuid**), reads sysfs/debugfs, and
  during an in-app Update it rewrites `/etc/nginx`, `/etc/systemd`, and the web
  root, then runs the per-project `install.sh` scripts. Almost every heavyweight
  directive breaks one of those.
- **Fix:** Add only the directives that harden without touching that surface:
  `ProtectKernelTunables/Modules/Logs`, `ProtectClock`, `ProtectHostname`,
  `RestrictNamespaces`, `RestrictRealtime`, `LockPersonality`. Plus an
  application-layer `_csrf_ok()` Origin/Host check on state-changing POSTs (see
  below), since the real exposure is a browser-driven request, not a local FS
  escape.
- **Rejected:** `NoNewPrivileges=yes` / `RestrictSUIDSGID=yes` — both break
  `su`/`sudo`, which the manager uses for every git op and app launch (symptom
  would be "sudo: a password is required" / EPERM). `ProtectSystem=strict` +
  `ReadWritePaths` — the Updater writes `/etc` and `/usr/local`; the allow-list
  would be large, fragile, and silently break a redeploy. `ProtectHome` — it
  writes the user's web root and `~/.config`. `PrivateTmp` — would hide the
  `/tmp/vibetop-session-*.sock` world the session children live in. `ProtectControlGroups` —
  left off because the manager spawns transient units via `systemd-run`.

## CSRF on the no-auth manager API (Origin check, not tokens)

- **Symptom:** Every `/api/*` endpoint trusts whatever reaches `127.0.0.1` — and
  some are destructive or RCE-shaped (`/api/x/launch` runs a shell command as
  `APP_USER`, `/api/reset`, `/api/update`). The trust model is "Cloudflare Access
  at the edge + a trusted LAN," so there's no app-layer auth. That leaves a CSRF
  hole: a malicious web page the user visits can `fetch()` the LAN/origin manager
  (a `text/plain` POST whose body is `json.loads`-parsed needs no CORS preflight,
  and the browser still attaches the user's Access cookie over the tunnel).
- **Fix:** `_csrf_ok()` rejects a POST whose `Origin` header is present but
  doesn't match `Host`. That blocks the cross-site browser case while leaving the
  legitimate non-browser callers untouched — `curl`/the operational CLI and the
  **OnlyOffice container's** server-side callback send *no* `Origin`, so they pass.
- **Rejected:** A CSRF token / session — there's no login or session to hang it
  on (auth is entirely at the Cloudflare edge), so a token would need its own
  bootstrap and storage for marginal gain over the Origin check. Blanket-blocking
  no-Origin requests — would break `curl`, health probes, and the OnlyOffice
  callback (the one server-to-server caller).

## `vibetop-session` shell-respawn needs backoff

- **Symptom:** Review flagged that the serve daemon's main loop respawns the shell
  the instant the child dies (`if reap_child(): ring.clear(); spawn_shell()`).
- **Cause:** If `/bin/bash` can't `exec` (missing, not executable, bad mount), the
  forked child `_exit(127)`s immediately, the PTY master goes readable with `EIO`
  so `select` returns at once, `reap_child()` is true next iteration, and it forks
  again — a **tight fork loop** pinning a CPU, with nothing throttling it.
- **Fix:** Track `last_spawn`; if a shell lived <1s, count it and `sleep` with
  capped exponential backoff + jitter (0.1s→8s) before respawning, resetting the
  counter once a shell survives. Normal `exit`-respawn (the shell lived a while)
  is unaffected — it respawns instantly as before.
- **Rejected:** A hard "give up after N" that leaves the terminal dead — a
  transient cause (a deploy mid-swap of `/bin/bash`) should self-heal; backoff
  recovers without a permanent dead tab.

## Mobile on-screen key bar (arrows/Esc/^C) lives at the TOP, not above the keyboard

- **Symptom:** The iOS soft keyboard has no arrows/Esc/Tab/Ctrl, so TUIs you
  navigate with ↑/↓ (Claude Code's picker, `git rebase -i`, `vim`) were unusable
  on a phone. Many attempts to put an accessory bar in the strip *just above the
  keyboard* failed: it either showed under iOS's own AutoFill/`^v Done` rows, or
  covered the terminal's prompt, or didn't show at all.
- **Cause:** The bottom strip is hostile on iOS and unfixable by tuning. (1) When
  the keyboard is raised by an input inside a *nested iframe* (the terminal is 2
  frames down), the **top frame's `visualViewport` doesn't shrink**, so the
  desktop can't even measure the keyboard to position a bar there. (2) iOS paints
  its **own accessory rows** (AutoFill/domain pill, form `^ v Done`) in that strip,
  over our content, at heights we can't measure or suppress (`autocomplete=off`
  doesn't stop the domain pill). Offsets became a per-device guessing game; a
  content-shift transform broke layout.
- **Fix:** Render ONE system-wide bar at the **desktop level, pinned to the TOP**
  of the screen (`#sys-keybar`, below the status-bar safe-area), shown while a
  keyboard is up. It never collides with the keyboard, the prompt (which the
  existing caret-park keeps just above the keyboard), or iOS keyboard chrome.
  Each tap routes `{type:'kbd-key', key}` to the active app's frame — the Browser
  (xpra-patches) already understood it; the Terminal relays it desktop →
  terminals.html → `/tN/`, where `terminal-kbd.js` maps it to PTY bytes (arrows =
  `ESC[A/B/C/D`). The terminal reports keyboard up/down so the desktop shows/hides.
- **Rejected:** Bottom placement with a per-context offset (`IOS_ACCESSORY`
  guess) — unverifiable and wrong on some devices. A CSS-transform "shift the
  terminal up" — fought iOS auto-scroll and broke layout. Relying on iOS to
  auto-scroll a focused textarea above the bar — doesn't work 3 iframes deep.
- **Testing lesson:** This was verified in **Playwright WebKit** (Safari's
  engine) driving the live stack with a `visualViewport`-mocked keyboard +
  screenshots, against a **throwaway terminal** (never the user's sessions).
  Chromium emulation passed a test the real iPhone failed — see
  [[mobile-ui-needs-webkit-or-device]] in memory: don't ship iOS UI blind.

## Mobile terminal typing: dropped keystrokes, dropped first letter, input lag

- **Symptom:** After the mobile keyboard work landed, typing in the **terminal
  only** (every other app was fine) would intermittently **drop the first
  letter**, **drop keystrokes entirely**, or feel **laggy** — "I have to type it
  a few times." None of this reproduced in the Browser/Notes overlays.
- **Cause:** Three independent bugs in the touch input path (the transparent
  overlay `terminal-kbd.js` + the `focusin` guard injected by
  `terminal/install.sh`), root-caused with an ultracode multi-agent workflow:
  1. **Blur-to-nothing.** The guard's job is to stop xterm's hidden
     `.xterm-helper-textarea` from raising the keyboard on load, so it blurred
     the helper whenever it took focus. But it blurred to **`document.body`** —
     not a text field. xterm re-focuses that helper constantly (WS-connect, every
     render), so mid-typing a steal → blur → **focus on `<body>` → the keystroke
     went nowhere.** Terminal-only because no other app fights xterm for focus.
  2. **Stale value-diff baseline.** Input is sent by diffing the overlay's value
     against `lastSent`, which was reset **only on Enter**. A typing session that
     began with leftover state (keyboard dismissed/re-summoned, an un-Entered
     line) mis-computed the **first** char's diff — swallowing it or emitting
     spurious backspaces.
  3. **Artificial 80 ms debounce.** Every keystroke sat in a `setTimeout(…, 80)`
     before reaching the PTY — batching meant for dictation, but pure latency for
     normal typing (Notes is a native field with none).
- **Fix:**
  1. The guard **bounces the stolen focus back to the overlay** instead of
     blurring to `<body>` — gated by `window.__termArmed` (set on the overlay's
     first genuine focus, so the keyboard still doesn't pop up on load) and
     `window.__termBouncing` (set around the guard's `focus()` call so the
     genuine-focus baseline reset below can tell a bounce from a real refocus and
     **never wipes in-flight input**). Focus can no longer land on `<body>`.
  2. **Reset the diff baseline (`ov.value`/`lastSent`) on a genuine refocus**
     (skipped when `__termBouncing`), so the first char of every session is sent
     as-is. The empty-value guard is also scoped to `composing` so a real line
     clear isn't swallowed.
  3. **Flush normal typing immediately** (synchronously in the `input` handler);
     only `composing` (dictation/IME) keeps the 400 ms debounce. The remaining
     gap from Notes is the **unavoidable PTY-echo round-trip** — the shell, not
     the browser, renders the char; small on LAN, = network RTT over the tunnel.
- **Rejected:** Lowering/removing the debounce alone (didn't address the focus
  drops). Resetting the baseline on **every** focus (the guard's bounce re-focus
  fires mid-typing, so this wiped in-flight chars — hence the `__termBouncing`
  gate). Letting the helper keep focus (xterm's native input streams half-formed
  dictation to the PTY — the very pile-up the overlay exists to prevent).
- **Testing lesson:** Same WebKit-on-throwaway-terminal harness as above. The
  focus-steal/bounce and the synchronous-vs-debounced flush are deterministic DOM
  behavior WebKit reproduces faithfully (unlike the keyboard-viewport quirks),
  so the harness caught all three before deploy. Don't touch the 80 ms→0 flush
  without re-checking the `composing` path still batches dictation.

## OnlyOffice "Download failed" over the Cloudflare tunnel (but fine on the LAN)

- **Symptom:** Opening/creating a doc in the Office app showed OnlyOffice's
  native **"Error: Download failed"** dialog — but **only over the tunnel**
  (`https://service…`), on *both* phone and desktop. The **LAN**
  (`http://z20.local`) worked. First mis-reported as phone-only (the phone was
  just the tunnel client), which echoes — but is **not** — the older mobile-editor
  "Download failed" (that one was the Community mobile web editor; fixed by
  forcing `cfg.type='desktop'`, still in place). Here the desktop editor loads
  fully, then the document never appears.
- **Cause:** **Mixed content.** The editor UI loads, then the browser fetches the
  converted document at `…/onlyoffice/cache/files/data/<key>/Editor.bin`. Over
  the tunnel that request **never reached the origin** (0 hits in nginx; a
  browser-side block, not an edge block — a request killed *before* it's sent).
  Why: OnlyOffice builds that as an **absolute** URL whose scheme comes from
  `X-Forwarded-Proto`. Our `onlyoffice.conf` sent `X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme`,
  but over the tunnel the `cloudflared → nginx` hop is plain **http**, so
  `$scheme=http` even though the client is on **https**. So the DS handed the
  browser an `http://service…/…/Editor.bin` link; on an **https** page that's
  active mixed content → blocked → "Download failed." On the **http** LAN page the
  http link is same-scheme, so it always worked. (Two red herrings ruled out
  first: the container *does* download the original doc fine — `GET /api/office/doc
  → 200` over the tunnel — and OnlyOffice's own `document_editor_service_worker.js`
  only registers in a secure context, but its scope is `/onlyoffice/<version>/`,
  so it never touches the `/onlyoffice/cache/` path.)
- **Fix:** Forward the **external** scheme: `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto
  $http_x_forwarded_proto;` in `office/nginx/onlyoffice.conf`. `cloudflared` sends
  `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`, so the DS now builds `https://` URLs over the
  tunnel; on a direct LAN request the header is absent → nginx omits it → the DS's
  own nginx (`http-common.conf`'s `$the_scheme` map) falls back to its `http`
  `$scheme`. Verified with `tcpdump` on loopback `:8087`: `X-Forwarded-Proto:
  https` now reaches the container and the `Editor.bin` GETs hit the origin.
- **Rejected:** Hardcoding `https` (breaks the http LAN — the reverse mixed-content
  problem). Patching the container's nginx (its `$the_scheme` map already honors
  the incoming header — the only broken hop was ours). An Access bypass for
  `/onlyoffice/*` (wrong layer — the request never reached Cloudflare; and it'd
  needlessly expose the editor/cache publicly). Chasing the server-side download
  path (the *container's* download was always 200; the failing fetch was the
  *browser's*).
- **Note:** purely an nginx-snippet change — no `sw.js`/shell bump (the PWA SW
  bypasses `/onlyoffice` and `office-editor.html` is network-only). Deploy gap
  found + closed alongside this: the in-app Updater redeployed
  `landing/`/`browser/`/`terminal/` but **not** `office/`, so this fix wouldn't
  have reached a host that updates via the app. The Updater now runs
  `office/install.sh` on an `office/` change — with the new `INSTALL_CONTAINER=0`
  knob so it only re-renders the nginx snippet and **leaves the live OnlyOffice
  container running** (tearing it down would drop open editors + cost ~1-2 min);
  container arg/image changes still need a full `deploy.sh`, exactly like
  systemd-unit changes for `browser/`/`terminal/`.

## Browser clicks land ~one line low after an xpra restart (xpra 6.5 regression)

- **Symptom:** In the Browser app, clicks registered ~one character/line **below**
  the cursor. Appeared with no Browser code change — it started right after an
  unrelated `systemctl restart vibetop-browser-xpra` (done while fixing other
  things). A second, **older deployment (`legion`, v1.9.10) did NOT have it**.
- **Cause:** **A server-side regression in xpra 6.5.** `apt` had upgraded
  `xpra 6.4.4 → 6.5` (here: 2026-06-27) but the *running* `vibetop-browser-xpra`
  process kept executing the old 6.4.4 binaries — and was fine. The restart loaded
  the new **6.5** binaries, which mis-place the click. Proof it's the server, not
  our code: the xpra **HTML5 client JS is byte-identical** between 6.4.4 and 6.5
  (`getMouse`, cursor `xhot/yhot` handling all the same), and `legion` (xpra 6.4)
  is immune. The 6.5 changelog documents **no** pointer/cursor change, so it's an
  unintended side effect (xpra has a long history of HTML5 mouse-offset bugs).
- **Fix:** Downgrade to the known-good version and pin it:
  `apt-get install --allow-downgrades xpra*=6.4.4-r0-1` (all 9 xpra packages) then
  `apt-mark hold` them, then restart `vibetop-browser-xpra` + `vibetop-apps-xpra`.
  Verify with `xpra info :99 | grep build.version` → `6.4`. Revisit (unhold +
  test) when a fixed xpra ships (6.5.x/6.6) or report it upstream.
- **Rejected (wasted ~2h):** Patching the click mapping in `xpra-patches.js`
  (`getMouse` canvas-rect math, then a native-cursor override). All no-ops/worse —
  the client coordinates were already correct (a debug overlay showed `getMouse`
  mapping 1:1 at top/middle/bottom). The bug was never in the JS.
- **Diagnostic lessons (the fast path next time):** (1) **Trust a known-good peer
  host** — `legion` running an older build immediately localized it to *something
  that changed on z20*, not the app. (2) For a "was-fine-now-broken with no code
  change" service bug, **check running-binary vs installed-package version**
  (`xpra info :99` build.version vs `dpkg -l xpra`): an `apt` upgrade doesn't
  restart the daemon, so a restart can silently swap in new, regressed binaries
  long after the upgrade. (3) A green on-screen debug overlay reporting
  `client→remote` coords (temporary, in `xpra-patches.js`) proved the client math
  was right and stopped the guess-and-deploy loop. See [[bisect-against-known-good-first]].

## Browser "loading" spinner every few seconds with TWO devices (stale xpra client state — NOT a code/version bug)

- **Symptom:** The Browser app reloads to the connecting/"loading" spinner every
  few seconds — **only the Browser** (Terminal is rock-solid), and **only when it's
  open on 2+ clients at once** (desktop + phone, or two tabs). A **single** client
  is always stable. Reported as version-specific (works on the older `legion` host,
  broken on `z20`).
- **Cause (validated):** **Accumulated stale runtime state, not code.** The session
  ended back on the *exact* stock build it started on (v1.11.6) and the Browser was
  fixed — so no code change cured it. What did: a full teardown+redeploy (1)
  **restarted `vibetop-browser-xpra` from zero** (`clients=0`), dropping accumulated
  **stale/zombie xpra clients** (backgrounded tabs, suspended-phone connections that
  hadn't hit `XPRA_PING_TIMEOUT` yet) all contending for the single shared session;
  and (2) made **both devices reload onto one consistent shell**, ending a
  cache-mismatch fight. The reload itself is `xpra-patches.js` patch 6 firing on
  each `connection-lost`, which turns the contention into a visible loop.
- **Cure (no redeploy/downgrade needed):** `sudo systemctl restart
  vibetop-browser-xpra` (or the desktop **Logout/reset** button, which does the
  same), then reload both devices. Clears the stale clients and resyncs the shells.
- **Why Terminal is immune:** ttyd + `vibetop-session` let many viewers share one
  PTY with no steal/session-ownership semantics; xpra has a single shared session
  that stale clients can wedge.
- **Rejected / dead ends (do NOT re-chase — each cost real time):**
  - **xpra 6.5** — the running binary was 6.4.4; 6.5 is the *click-offset* bug
    (separate entry above), unrelated to this loop.
  - **A vibetop version regression** — `git diff 689bb6e(v1.9.10=legion) HEAD --
    browser/` shows the Browser stack is byte-identical to legion (same xpra flags,
    same `/browser/` iframe); downgrading the code changes nothing for the Browser.
  - **Forcing client sharing via the iframe URL** (`/browser/?sharing=true&steal=false`):
    made it **worse** — a non-sharing/steal mismatch across mixed cached shells
    caused `Disconnecting … session busy (this session is already active)`
    reject-loops. Reverted.
  - **`--clipboard-direction=to-server`** to kill the clipboard-storm
    (`Warning: more than 30 clipboard requests per second!`): the storm is a
    *symptom* of two clients syncing, not the disconnect cause; didn't fix the loop.
  - **A full v1.9.10 redeploy** as the apples-to-apples legion test: tripped a
    **separate** xpra failure on z20 — `authentication failed: missing remote
    username` (the HTML5 login window) despite `--ws-auth=none`, which v1.11.6 does
    NOT exhibit. Left uninvestigated; it broke the Browser entirely, so the legion
    comparison never actually ran.
- **Operational gotchas hit along the way (worth caution):**
  - **`deploy.sh` must run as the user, NOT `sudo`.** `sudo ./deploy.sh` runs the
    no-sudo `landing/install.sh` as root → web root deploys to `/root/...www`
    instead of `~/...www`, and `/browser/` 404s/ERRs. Run `./deploy.sh` (it `sudo`s
    per-step internally).
  - **Don't deploy mismatched shells to a multi-client xpra.** Flip-flopping the
    deployed shell while two devices are connected leaves them on different cached
    builds that can't agree to share — it manufactures the very loop you're chasing.
    If you must change the iframe/shell, bump `sw.js` VERSION and reload **all**
    devices before judging the result.
- **Diagnostic fast-path:** `xpra info :99 | grep clients=` — **one client = stable**
  immediately localizes it to multi-client stale state. Then read the live journal
  disconnect **reason** (`journalctl -u vibetop-browser-xpra -f`) *before* changing
  anything — `same uuid` = a client reconnecting, `session busy` = a sharing/steal
  mismatch, `missing remote username` = an auth/deploy problem. See
  [[bisect-against-known-good-first]], [[fix-root-cause-keep-the-feature]].
