# Vibetop

**Your self-hosted machine, as a desktop in any browser tab — even your phone.**

A unified "mini-OS" desktop experience served in the browser, exposed publicly
over HTTPS via Cloudflare Tunnel with Access auth. The root page is a desktop-like
UI launchable from a Start menu with seven everyday apps — **Home Service,
Terminal, Browser, Files, Notes, Monitor, Upload** — plus a self-updating
**Update** app. Open-app state is synced server-side so phone and computer share
the same desktop. Installable as a PWA; the Terminal even keeps iOS voice
dictation working. Deploys to any Ubuntu host with one command (AMD or NVIDIA).

## Features

- **Terminal** — persistent bash sessions over ttyd; tabs survive disconnects via a custom `claude-session` daemon (256 KB ring buffer + 50k-line xterm.js scrollback). On touch, tapping the terminal raises the keyboard via an in-page overlay that makes **iOS dictation work** (no character pile-up); on Windows, Ctrl+V pastes cleanly
- **Browser** — a real, persistent Chromium driven by xpra's HTML5 client; mobile gets tap-click, drag-scroll, two-finger pinch zoom, and a toggleable on-screen keyboard
- **Files** — FileBrowser rooted at `~`, every toolbar action visible inline (wraps to multiple rows on mobile). Tap a Word/Excel/PPT file to **View** it (server renders a read-only PDF via headless LibreOffice, shown in an in-app viewer); the viewer's **Edit** button opens it in the **Office** app
- **Office** — full in-browser Word/Excel/PowerPoint editing via a self-hosted **OnlyOffice Document Server** (Docker), with autosave back to the file. Native browser rendering — fast, MS-compatible, no remote-desktop streaming
- **Notes** — single-page Markdown scratchpad, auto-saves
- **Monitor** — live CPU/MEM/GPU charts, htop-style load average, top processes
- **Upload** — quick photo-sync drop zone; per-file progress, In-folder listing, Open-in-Files deep link
- **Update** — one-tap self-update: `git pull` from GitHub, redeploy only what changed, and an **update-history changelog** with the installed commit badged
- **Status bar** — live system stats (CPU %/°, MEM, GPU %/°, VRAM) at the bottom of every desktop. GPU from AMD sysfs (with a debugfs fallback when it locks under compute) **or NVIDIA `nvidia-smi`**

## Sub-projects

| Sub-project | URL path | What |
|---|---|---|
| `terminal` | `/t1/`..`/t50/`, `/terminals/`, `/api/` | Dynamic persistent bash terminals (ttyd + claude-session) + manager API |
| `browser`  | `/browser/` | Persistent Chromium viewable via xpra HTML5 client |
| `landing`  | `/` | Unified desktop UI with tab bar, iframe viewport, and status bar |
| `files`    | `/files/` | FileBrowser file manager rooted at `~` |
| `office`   | `/onlyoffice/` | OnlyOffice Document Server (Docker) — in-browser Office editing, autosaved via the manager's `/api/office/*` endpoints |
| `tunnel`   | — | Cloudflare Tunnel + Access config for public HTTPS |

## Deploy

One command does the whole stack (installs deps, runs every sub-installer in
order, health-checks), locally or to a remote host over SSH:

```bash
./deploy.sh                                # deploy on this machine
./deploy.sh --remote user@host             # rsync to host:~/vibetop and deploy there
# flags: --no-browser  --no-files  --with-tunnel  --dry-run
```

Or run the per-project installers by hand (the order `deploy.sh` uses; each is
idempotent, `--dry-run`-able, env-var configurable):

```bash
sudo ./terminal/install.sh   # nginx skeleton + manager API + ttyd
sudo ./browser/install.sh    # xpra + Chromium (snap)
sudo ./files/install.sh      # FileBrowser at /files/
./landing/install.sh         # desktop UI + static apps (no sudo)
sudo ./tunnel/install.sh     # cloudflared (tunnel setup is interactive)
```

The installers pull their own dependencies — `ttyd`/`nginx`/`acl` (apt), `xpra`
(xpra.org repo) + `chromium` (snap), and the `filebrowser` release binary — and
set up the systemd units, nginx site, and the www-data home-dir ACL. Validated
end-to-end on AMD+NVIDIA and AMD+AMD Ubuntu 24.04 hosts. Remotely-deployed hosts
are full installs — they self-update from the Start menu like the primary box.

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for full architecture, health checks, and operational
commands, and [`docs/`](docs/) for deep dives.
