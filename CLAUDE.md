# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

Five sub-projects deliver a unified "mini-OS" desktop experience on myhost (`192.168.1.10`), exposed publicly at `https://service.example.com/` via Cloudflare Tunnel with Access auth. The root page (`/`) is a desktop-like UI launchable from a Start menu with seven everyday apps (Home Service, Terminal, Browser, Files, Notes, Monitor, Upload) plus an **Update** app in a separate "System" section.

| Sub-project | URL path | What |
|---|---|---|
| terminal | `/t1/`..`/t50/`, `/terminals/`, `/api/` | Dynamic persistent bash terminals (ttyd + claude-session) + manager API |
| browser | `/browser/` | Persistent Chromium viewable via xpra HTML5 client |
| landing | `/` | Unified desktop UI with tab bar, iframe viewport, and status bar |
| files | `/files/` | FileBrowser file manager rooted at `~` |
| tunnel | — | Cloudflare Tunnel + Access config for public HTTPS |

## Deploy commands

**One command, whole stack** — `deploy.sh` orchestrates everything (deps + all
sub-installers in the right order + a health check), locally or to a remote host:

```bash
./deploy.sh                                  # deploy on this machine
./deploy.sh --remote junjie@192.168.1.20     # rsync to HOST:~/vibetop and deploy there
# flags: --no-browser  --no-files  --with-tunnel  --dry-run
# (HOST is any ssh destination — user@ip or an ssh-config Host, not a bare shell alias)
```

Or run the per-project installers by hand (the order `deploy.sh` uses). Each is
idempotent, supports `--dry-run`, and is env-var configurable (see script headers):

```bash
sudo ./terminal/install.sh   # 1. nginx site skeleton (extras include) + manager API + ttyd
sudo ./browser/install.sh    # 2. xpra + Chromium (snap, auto-installed) — drops an extras snippet
sudo ./files/install.sh      # 3. FileBrowser at /files/ (binary + noauth config + extras snippet)
./landing/install.sh         # 4. desktop UI + static apps (no sudo — $HOME must resolve to the user's)
sudo ./tunnel/install.sh     # 5. cloudflared (tunnel setup is interactive — see tunnel/README.md)
```

Deps the installers handle automatically: `ttyd`/`nginx`/`acl` (apt), `xpra` (xpra.org
apt repo, suite derived from the OS codename) + `chromium` (snap), and the
`filebrowser` release binary (pinned `FB_VERSION`, arch-aware). Portability is
validated on AMD+NVIDIA and AMD+AMD hosts (GPU stats use sysfs/amdgpu with an
`nvidia-smi` fallback).

## Health check

```bash
systemctl status claude-web-manager claude-browser-xpra claude-web-filebrowser
curl -sI http://127.0.0.1/ http://127.0.0.1/t1/ http://127.0.0.1/browser/ http://127.0.0.1/files/
curl -s http://127.0.0.1/api/system/status
curl -s http://127.0.0.1/api/terminals/status
sudo systemctl status cloudflared
```

## Architecture

### Unified desktop (`landing/desktop.html`)

The root page at `/` is a Windows-style shell:
- **Start button** — always present at the taskbar's left. Clicking it toggles the **Start menu**, a launcher listing seven everyday apps (Home Service, Terminal, Browser, Files, Notes, Monitor, Upload), then a separated **System** subsection with the **Update** app (set apart since it's rarely used), each with icon + description. Picking one opens it. (This replaced the old always-pinned tab bar.) **Home Service** is the old service-list page (`landing/index.html`, served at `/landing.html`) wrapped as a launchable app — it shows the service cards, health dots, and dynamic terminal chips. Its extra service cards (and their health-check targets) are **not** in the repo: they're read at runtime from a host-local, gitignored `~/claude-web-www/services.json` (format in `landing/services.example.json`). The page renders them from a direct `/services.json` fetch (LAN) or a parent `postMessage` relay (tunnel), and `terminal-manager.py` merges each entry's `key`/`health` into `/api/health` so the dots work — keeping personal hostnames/IPs out of git.
- **Taskbar apps** — only *opened* apps get a button (Windows-style), each with a close (×). Multiple apps can be open at once; the focused one is highlighted with a per-app accent underline. Buttons are **drag-reorderable** (HTML5 DnD — desktop only; it's a no-op on touch so tap/scroll are unaffected): dragover reshuffles the DOM live, dragend reads the new order back into `openApps` and persists it. The set of open apps, their order, and the active one are persisted **server-side** via `GET/POST /api/desktop` (file `~/.local/share/desktop-state.json`) so phone and computer see the same desktop. Restored on every load; on a fresh state with nothing open the Start menu auto-opens.
- **App frames** — each app is a full-viewport iframe, **created** on first open but only `src`-loaded on first activation (`loadIfNeeded`) so the inner content always measures the real viewport (otherwise xterm.js / FitAddon initialise at 0×0 and the terminal renders truncated). Closed apps are **removed from the DOM** (true unload). All iframes carry `allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"` for cross-iframe clipboard.
- **Status bar** — live system stats updated every 5s via `/api/system/status`: CPU% + temp, MEM used/total, GPU% + temp, VRAM used/total. Rendered in a fixed-width CSS grid (`ch`-sized columns + `tabular-nums`) so labels don't shift sideways as values change digit-count. CPU temp from `k10temp` (Tctl), GPU temp from `amdgpu` (edge). When the GPU driver locks sysfs during heavy compute (EBUSY), util/temp/power **fall back to parsing `/sys/kernel/debug/dri/N/amdgpu_pm_info`** (manager already runs as root) so the numbers stay populated. The full 1/5/15-minute load average is shown only in the Monitor app's CPU card title.
- **Logout button** — taskbar far right, links to `/cdn-cgi/access/logout` (Cloudflare Access).
- **PWA / installable** — `landing/manifest.json` (+ `apple-*` meta tags and an `apple-touch-icon` in `desktop.html`) makes "Add to Home Screen" launch the desktop **standalone** (no Safari chrome — which is why the `100svh`/URL-bar juggling matters less once installed). `landing/sw.js` is a service worker that caches the shell + static app pages (`/`, `landing.html`, `notes.html`, `monitor.html`, `upload.html`, patches JS, icons) for instant cold loads. It is **deliberately conservative**: page loads (`navigate` requests) are **network-first with a 2.5s timeout** — so Cloudflare Access redirects still work (an expired session returns a redirect that's passed through and never cached) while a *stalled* network falls back to the cached shell (the iOS-Safari-on-flaky-wifi case); static sub-resources are cache-first/stale-while-revalidate; and everything live or auth-sensitive (`/api`, `/browser`, `/tN`, `/terminals`, `/files`, `/fileview`, `/services.json`, `/cdn-cgi`) is **bypassed** entirely (network only, never cached). Bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` to invalidate the cache after a shell change; `activate` deletes old caches, and nginx serves `sw.js` `no-store` so the browser re-checks it. Icons are generated by `landing/icons/generate-icons.py` (a 2×2 launcher grid in the app accent colors). On iOS an installed PWA has its own cookie jar, so the first launch may require a one-time Access re-auth.
- Relays `/api/health`, `/api/terminals/status`, and `/services.json` to the Home Service app via `postMessage`, only while it's open — required for the Cloudflare tunnel where an iframe's own fetches don't carry the Access cookie, so the parent fetches and forwards. (Monitor fetches `/api/system/status` itself and uses no relayed data.)
- Listens for `postMessage` from the terminal app to open a clicked URL in the Browser app (launching Browser if it isn't already open). Also handles `open-files-at` (from the Upload app) to deep-link the Files app at a given path.
- **Mobile** — viewport meta is pinned (`user-scalable=no`) since iOS pinch-zoom is page-wide and once stuck can't be reliably reset; each app handles its own zoom internally (xpra zooms the canvas, Monitor and FileBrowser have their own responsive layouts). Body uses `100svh` so the taskbar stays in the always-visible region under the URL bar. The taskbar is horizontally scrollable when narrow, the Start menu spans the screen, and `monitor.html`'s 736px breakpoint collapses its two-column grid into a single scrollable column. xterm.js auto-focus is **suppressed on touch devices** so auto-switching into Terminal doesn't pop up the on-screen keyboard — the user taps the terminal to summon it. This has two sources: the desktop's `focus-terminal` `postMessage` (skipped on touch) **and ttyd's own focus when its WebSocket connects** (the one that fires on a fresh load — e.g. closing Browser auto-switches to a never-yet-loaded Terminal). The latter is caught by a guard injected into every `/tN/` page via the `sub_filter` in `terminal/install.sh`: on touch, it blurs any focus of the `.xterm-helper-textarea` unless it lands within 700ms of a real touch **inside the terminal page** (a genuine tap whitelists itself in the capture phase; the parent's close-× tap does not).

### Shared nginx

One nginx site at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/claude-web` (`listen 80 default_server`). The terminal project owns this file. A `map $uri $term_port` directive (generated for 1..50) routes `/tN/` to port `7680+N` via a single regex location block. Sibling projects extend via `include /etc/nginx/snippets/claude-extras.d/*.conf`.

### Terminal stack

**Dynamic provisioning** — terminals are created/destroyed on demand via a manager API, not pre-provisioned.

Services:
- `claude-web-manager.service` — threaded Python HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:7680` (runs as root; `ThreadingHTTPServer` so a slow request — a multi-GB upload, health probes — can't block the status polls). Manages terminal lifecycle and provides system status. Endpoints:
  - Terminal: `POST /api/terminals/{n}/start|stop`, `GET /api/terminals/status`
  - System: `GET /api/system/status` (CPU + per-core, MEM, GPU, VRAM, load_avg, etc.), `GET /api/health`
  - Browser: `POST /api/browser/open` (validated URL → remote Chromium via the xpra display)
  - Notes: `GET/POST /api/notes` (`~/.local/share/desktop-notes.md`)
  - Desktop state: `GET/POST /api/desktop` (`~/.local/share/desktop-state.json` — `{open: [appId,...], active: appId}`, shared between phone and computer)
  - Upload: `POST /api/upload` (streaming multipart parser, writes into `UPLOAD_DIR`, default `~/Uploads`), `GET /api/upload/list`, `POST /api/upload/clear`
  - Update: `GET /api/update` (installed commit/date/subject), `POST /api/update` (`git pull --ff-only` + redeploy)
- `claude-web-session@N.service` — `claude-session serve N` (Python daemon holding bash in a PTY, started on demand)
- `claude-web-ttyd@N.service` — ttyd on `127.0.0.1:$((7680+N))`, base path `/tN/` (started on demand)

nginx proxies `/tN/` to the corresponding loopback port via the `map`-based regex location. `sub_filter` injects scrollback config, clipboard polyfill, and a `window.open` override that sends URL clicks to the embedded Chromium browser via `/api/browser/open`.

`claude-session` is a custom lightweight replacement for tmux that passes terminal output through transparently (no screen repainting), enabling xterm.js's 50k-line scrollback buffer. It records output in a 256KB ring buffer and replays it on reconnect so the screen state is preserved. Typing `exit` respawns a fresh shell within ~1s; ttyd's `reconnect=3` auto-reconnects the browser tab. ttyd only auto-reconnects on an **abnormal** WS close; a *clean* close (code 1000, which iOS produces when it suspends a backgrounded tab) instead shows a **"Press ⏎ to Reconnect"** overlay and waits for a keypress. A guard injected into every `/tN/` page (the `sub_filter` in `terminal/install.sh`) watches for that overlay via `MutationObserver` and synthesizes the Enter keypress ttyd's `onKey` handler is waiting for, so the terminal reconnects on its own like the other apps — riding ttyd's in-place reconnect (xterm scrollback preserved; `claude-session` replays its ring buffer). The observer is attached only once `document.body` exists (the script runs in `<head>`, so it retries via `startObs`) and also checks for an already-present overlay on load. If the synthesized Enter doesn't clear the overlay within 1.2 s, it falls back to a full `location.reload()` (which reconnects fresh and replays the ring buffer), guarded to at most once per 8 s via `sessionStorage` so a genuinely-down terminal can't reload-loop. Also covers the case where a socket `error` set `doReconnect=false` (same overlay).

A tabbed UI at `/terminals/` (`terminal/terminals.html`) manages terminal tabs with add (+), close (x, stops the service), drag-reorder, and double-click-to-rename. Tab state persists in localStorage. Closing a tab kills the terminal for a clean slate; clicking "+" starts a fresh instance. Switching tabs auto-focuses the xterm.js terminal via `postMessage` so the cursor is ready for typing (skipped on touch devices — see the Mobile note above).

**Mobile keyboard/dictation** — `landing/terminal-kbd.js`, injected into every `/tN/` page via the `sub_filter` `<script src>` (a no-op on non-touch; **desktop keeps native xterm** — all keys, tap-to-focus, selection). On touch it lays a transparent `<textarea>` over the **bottom** of the terminal: tapping the lower (prompt) area focuses it, so iOS raises the keyboard and **dictation buffers into a real field natively** (like Notes) instead of xterm streaming half-finished revisions to the PTY (the pile-up). Input is forwarded as a debounced value-diff via xterm's `coreService.triggerDataEvent` (ignoring iOS dictation's transient clear-to-`""`); Enter→CR, Backspace→DEL, Tab→TAB; arrows/Ctrl/Esc aren't on the iOS keyboard so they're not forwarded. The textarea is `position:absolute;bottom:0` with the caret pushed to the prompt line (big `padding-top`) so iOS **scrolls the whole shell up** to clear the keyboard, like the native terminal where xterm's textarea sits at the cursor. xterm's own helper textarea is blocked from taking focus on touch (the `focusin` guard in the sub_filter) so only this input raises the keyboard; vertical drags pass through as scrollback. The desktop shell's ⌨ button is therefore **Browser-only** now (the Browser is an xpra canvas with no DOM input; the Terminal no longer needs it).

### Browser stack

One systemd service:
- `claude-browser-xpra` — xpra `start-desktop :99` with built-in HTML5 client on loopback:14500

xpra handles the virtual X display (Xorg + dummy video driver for RANDR), window management (matchbox in kiosk mode), browser launching (via `browser-loop.sh` wrapper for auto-restart), and the HTML5 client + WebSocket serving. The display dynamically resizes to match the client's browser viewport. Clipboard is handled natively by xpra. xpra is installed from the xpra.org apt repo. `--sharing=yes` lets multiple clients (e.g. desktop + phone) view the same session at once; `XPRA_PING_TIMEOUT=45` (env in the unit) evicts dead clients faster than the 60s default — but not lower than 45: phones on power-saving WiFi stall past 20s while alive, and backgrounded Safari tabs stop answering pings, so a 20s timeout evicted live clients.

nginx proxies `/browser/` to xpra's HTTP/WebSocket port with `sub_filter` patches: CSS pins `#screen` to the viewport via `z-index` (hiding xpra's toolbar/login UI and window-decoration chrome like `.windowhead`/`.window-title` without removing keyboard capture elements like `#pasteboard`), and loads `xpra-patches.js` for mouse offset correction, scroll fix, and **mobile touch handling**. The patches JS file is served from the web root and wrapped in `try/catch` for graceful degradation on xpra updates. A separate regex location caches (`max-age=86400`) and gzips xpra's ~2.1MB HTML5 client assets, which xpra otherwise serves uncompressed and `no-store` — the main fix for slow first loads over the tunnel. See `docs/browser.md`.

**Mobile touch in xpra-patches.js** — the parent desktop disables iOS pinch-zoom, so all touch gestures are interpreted inside the iframe. A single capture-phase set of `touchstart`/`touchmove`/`touchend` listeners on `window` (xpra binds on `#screen` so we must run first) routes gestures by finger count:
- **1-finger tap (< 10px movement)** → synthetic `mousedown`/`mouseup`/`click` dispatched on the canvas inside `#screen` so xpra forwards a click to the remote.
- **2-finger pinch** → **Safari-style view magnification**: a client-side CSS `transform: translate() scale()` on `#screen` (`VIEWZOOM` state), anchored at the pinch midpoint. The remote layout is **unchanged** — it just magnifies the rendered canvas and lets you pan, exactly like Safari zooms a page (an earlier version sent `Ctrl+=`/`Ctrl+-` to Chromium, which reflowed the layout / enlarged fonts — not what "zoom" should do). Purely local; the remote never sees it. `getMouse` (patch 1) divides click coords by `VIEWZOOM.z` so taps still land correctly while magnified. Zoom resets to 1× on `orientationchange`. No on-screen zoom buttons — pinch out to zoom, pinch back to return to 1×.
- **1-finger drag** → **pan when magnified, scroll at 1×**: zoomed in, the drag pans the CSS-magnified view (clamped to the viewport); at 1× it scrolls the remote page on **both axes** via synthetic `wheel` events on the canvas (vertical `deltaY` + horizontal `deltaX`, accumulated per-axis into `SCROLL_TICK` chunks, default 33, so speed roughly matches the finger).
- **Native keyboard** — xpra's drawn `.simple-keyboard` is hidden; instead a real **`<input>` (`#xpra-kbd`) IS the round ⌨ button** on the right edge. This is the crux: **iOS only raises the keyboard when the user taps a real text input directly** — programmatically `focus()`-ing a separate hidden input (from a `<div>` button, or from a canvas tap) does *not* work. So the input itself is the tap target (transparent text/caret, `font-size:16px` to avoid focus-zoom; the ⌨/✕ glyph is a `pointer-events:none` sibling overlay). Tapping it focuses it → keyboard; a second tap (when already focused) blurs to dismiss (`pointerdown` + `activeElement` check). The window-capture touch layer (patch 4) **ignores taps on `#vkb-toggle`** (`onChip` guard) so the input's native focus isn't prevented. Typed characters are forwarded to the remote as synthetic key events (xpra reads `event.code`/`key`/`keyCode`; its handlers don't check `isTrusted`), built by **diffing the input's value** on each `input` event so backspace and autocorrect replacements work; Enter/Tab/empty-backspace go via `keydown`.
- **Paste on non-Mac** — xpra uses Meta as its clipboard modifier on macOS but Control elsewhere, via the browser `paste` event, which is unreliable on Windows (Cmd+V works, Ctrl+V often doesn't). On non-Mac the patch intercepts `Ctrl+V` (capture phase, before xpra's document handler), reads the local clipboard, and types it into the remote via the same synthetic-key path. The working Mac Cmd+V path is untouched.

### File manager

- `claude-web-filebrowser.service` — [FileBrowser](https://filebrowser.org/) on `127.0.0.1:8085`, base URL `/files`, root at `~`, no auth (Cloudflare Access handles public auth).
- nginx snippet at `/etc/nginx/snippets/claude-extras.d/filebrowser.conf` proxies `/files/` to it. The nginx config injects `filebrowser-patches.js` via `sub_filter` on both the exact `/files/` and prefix `/files/*` locations.
- Config stored in `~/.config/filebrowser/filebrowser.db`. Hidden files are hidden by default (toggle in FileBrowser's UI).

**UI patches** (`landing/filebrowser-patches.js`, served from web root):

FileBrowser's icon-only toolbar buttons are enhanced with text labels and an "Open in Browser" action:
- **Text labels** — header and inline `#dropdown` action buttons get column layout (icon above, label below) via injected CSS. Verbose labels are shortened (e.g. "Copy file" → "Copy", "Switch view" → "View").
- **Permanent action buttons** — Browser, Share, Rename, Copy, Move, Delete, Download buttons are always visible in the header toolbar. They are greyed out (25% opacity, non-clickable) when no file/folder is selected, and active when a selection exists. Vue's own conditional buttons are hidden to avoid duplication. The Browser button is only active for files, not folders. When clicked, non-Browser buttons delegate to Vue's hidden original button via programmatic `.click()` — the hiding CSS must not use `pointer-events:none` or the click delegation breaks.
- **"Open in Browser" action** — opens the selected file in the embedded Chromium via `POST /api/browser/open` and auto-switches to the Browser tab via `postMessage`. (The native right-click `.context-menu` is hidden by these patches, so nothing is injected into it.) The `/fileview/` location it relies on is a template — render `@APP_HOME@` when deploying `files/nginx/filebrowser.conf`.
- **MutationObserver** — patches run on every DOM change (with `aria-selected` attribute filter) so labels, button state, and Vue button hiding apply instantly without flicker. A 2s fallback interval covers edge cases.
- **Mobile (≤736px)** — the header toolbar uses `flex-wrap: wrap` so every action button is visible across multiple rows instead of being clipped or hidden behind a `…` overflow trigger; `#dropdown` is forced to render inline (not as a popup) and the more-button is hidden. FileBrowser's stock bottom-floating selection bar (`#file-selection`) and the long-press `.context-menu` are hidden globally — every action already lives in the top toolbar so the popups are redundant. nginx sub_filter loads `filebrowser-patches.js` with a `?vN` cache-buster bumped whenever the CSS changes.

### Notes

A persistent scratchpad at `/notes.html`. Auto-saves 800ms after typing, supports Tab and Cmd+S. Content stored at `~/.local/share/desktop-notes.md`, managed via `GET/POST /api/notes` on the manager API. No external service — just a static HTML page + the existing API server. A **link bar** above the textarea auto-detects every `http(s)` URL in the note (a textarea can't host clickable text) and shows each as a tappable chip; tapping one opens it in the embedded Browser via the parent desktop's `open-in-browser` `postMessage` (direct `/api/browser/open` fallback when standalone). URLs are percent-escaped for the manager's metacharacter filter (`( ) ' " \` $ ;`) so links with parens/semicolons aren't rejected.

### Upload

A quick-sync drop zone at `/upload.html` — useful for getting photos off a phone fast. Tap-to-pick fires the OS picker (iOS opens the photo gallery / files / camera); drag-and-drop works on desktop. Files upload **sequentially**, one XHR per file, so each item in the queue shows its own live percentage badge (0 % → 100 % → ✓ Done / Failed) while the top bar shows aggregate progress. Below the queue, an **In folder** panel lists files currently in `UPLOAD_DIR` (newest first) with Refresh and Clear-all controls, refreshed after every successful upload. An **Open in Files** button deep-links the Files app at the upload folder via an `open-files-at` `postMessage` to the parent desktop. Default destination is `~/Uploads/` (override with `UPLOAD_DIR` env on the manager unit); files are chowned to `APP_USER` after save. nginx's `/api/` location sets `client_max_body_size 5G` and `proxy_request_buffering off` so multi-GB uploads stream through. The manager's multipart parser is hand-rolled and streaming (does NOT spool to temp via `cgi.FieldStorage`).

### Update

A self-update app at `/update.html` (Start menu → **System** section) that pulls the latest commit from GitHub and redeploys, driven by the manager. `GET /api/update` shows the installed commit/date/subject; `POST /api/update`:
1. `git pull --ff-only` in `REPO_DIR` (the manager's own checkout, `<repo>/terminal/terminal-manager.py` → `<repo>`). Git runs as `APP_USER` via **`sudo -u APP_USER -H`** (not `su -`, which would print the host MOTD banner into the output) — the repo owner, who also holds the GitHub SSH key (root would trip git's "dubious ownership" guard). Non-interactive SSH must work (passphraseless key / agent).
2. If the pull brought changes, redeploy **only what changed** (by `git diff --name-only`): `landing/` → `landing/install.sh` (as `APP_USER`); `browser/` → `browser/install.sh`; `terminal/` → `terminal/install.sh` (regenerates the nginx site). The browser/terminal scripts run **as root** (the manager is root) with `APP_USER=… INSTALL_DEPS=0 INSTALL_SYSTEMD=0` so they only redeploy files + reload nginx.
3. If `terminal/terminal-manager.py` itself changed, the manager restarts **out-of-band** via `systemd-run --on-active=3 systemctl restart claude-web-manager` (a transient timer, so the restart survives the manager's own death — a child in the manager's cgroup would be killed mid-restart). The response is sent first; `update.html` re-polls the version after the blip.

The whole log (each step's stdout/stderr + ok/fail) is returned and shown in the app. **Bootstrap:** the *first* deploy of this feature needs a manual `sudo systemctl restart claude-web-manager` (the running manager predates the `/api/update` route); after that it self-updates.

### Landing page (`landing/index.html`)

The old service listing page, preserved at `/landing.html` and loaded in the Home tab. Shows cards for each service with health-check dots. Terminal section dynamically shows chips for each running terminal (fetched from `/api/terminals/status`). Health data is relayed from the parent desktop via `postMessage` to work through the Cloudflare tunnel. All external service links use `target="_blank"` to open in new native tabs (required since the page is inside an iframe).

### URL forwarding (terminal/files → browser)

Clicking a URL in a terminal (Cmd+click / Ctrl+click) or using the "Open in Browser" action in Files opens it in the embedded Chromium. Implementation:
- nginx `sub_filter` injects a `window.open` override into terminal pages
- The override intercepts xterm.js's link handler (which calls `window.open()` then sets `.location.href`) and returns a proxy object
- The proxy sends the URL to `POST /api/browser/open`, which runs `chromium <url>` on the xpra display
- The manager passes `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` and `--user-data-dir` matching the xpra profile so the URL opens in the correct Chromium instance
- A `postMessage` to the parent desktop auto-switches to the Browser tab
- Files opened from FileBrowser use the `/fileview/` nginx location (alias to `~`) to serve raw files to Chromium

### Tunnel

`cloudflared` maintains an outbound connection to Cloudflare. All traffic for `service.example.com` routes to `localhost:80`. Cloudflare Access handles auth (email PIN + Google). Config lives at `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml` (rendered from `tunnel/config.yml.template`).

## Uninstall

Each sub-project (except landing) has an idempotent `uninstall.sh` that reverses its install. They leave apt packages and user data (browser profile, shell history) in place.

```bash
sudo ./terminal/uninstall.sh          # stops units, removes nginx site
sudo ./browser/uninstall.sh           # stops units, removes nginx snippet
sudo ./tunnel/uninstall.sh            # N/A — uninstall cloudflared manually
```

All support `--dry-run`.

## Key operational commands

```bash
# Terminal operations
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1/api/terminals/5/start  # start terminal 5
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1/api/terminals/5/stop   # stop terminal 5
curl http://127.0.0.1/api/terminals/status            # list running terminals
sudo systemctl restart claude-web-manager             # restart manager API

# Browser operations

All `install.sh` scripts share the same patterns:
- Idempotent and re-runnable. `--dry-run` (or `-n`) previews without acting.
- Env vars override defaults (e.g. `MAX_INSTANCES=50`, `XPRA_PORT=14500`). See the header comment in each script for the full list.
- Systemd unit files under `*/systemd/` are templates with `@PLACEHOLDER@` tokens (e.g. `@APP_USER@`, `@DISPLAY_NUM@`). install.sh renders them via `sed` and writes to `/etc/systemd/system/`.
- nginx configs under `*/nginx/` follow the same pattern.

## Gotchas

- Snap chromium can't use `--user-data-dir` outside its confinement — the xpra profile lives at `~/snap/chromium/common/xpra-profile`. The `/api/browser/open` handler must pass this profile and `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/<uid>/bus` when running `chromium` via `su`, otherwise the URL silently goes nowhere ("Opening in existing browser session" fails without D-Bus, and without `--user-data-dir` it targets the wrong Chromium instance)
- xpra is installed from xpra.org's apt repo (GPG key at `/usr/share/keyrings/xpra.asc`, source at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/xpra.sources`) — Ubuntu's packaged v3.1.5 is too old (no HTML5 client)
- The browser-loop.sh wrapper (at `/usr/local/lib/claude-browser/browser-loop.sh`) auto-restarts chromium on crash — xpra's `--start-child` only runs the command once
- Desktop page at `~/claude-web-www/index.html` is `landing/desktop.html`; old landing page preserved at `~/claude-web-www/landing.html`
- `www-data` gets traversal on `/home/myuser` via ACL (`setfacl`), preserving the home dir's 0750 mode
- xterm.js scrollback requires `sub_filter` injection in nginx — ttyd 1.7.4's runtime option setter doesn't resize the buffer
- Clipboard in terminals uses a DOM-based copy technique injected via nginx `sub_filter`: on selection change, the selected text is written into xterm.js's helper textarea, selected via `ta.select()`, then copied via `document.execCommand('copy')`. This is the only approach that works inside nested iframes — the async Clipboard API (`navigator.clipboard.writeText`) and `clipboardData.setData()` in copy event handlers are both silently blocked by browsers in iframe contexts. Ctrl+C/Cmd+C with a selection copies instead of sending SIGINT; Ctrl+V/Cmd+V paste is handled natively by the browser
- All desktop iframes use `allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"` — without this, clipboard paste into the xpra browser iframe fails
- Terminal iframes in `terminals.html` also need `allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"` for clipboard to work through the double-nested iframe chain (desktop → terminals → /tN/)
- `claude-session` attach client clears `ICRNL` from terminal input flags so `\r` (Enter) passes through to TUI apps like Claude Code without being converted to `\n`. Does NOT use full `tty.setraw()` to preserve output post-processing
- xpra CSS uses `z-index` overlay (not `display:none`) to hide the toolbar — hiding body children with `display:none` breaks keyboard input because xpra's `#pasteboard` textarea (used for keyboard capture) must remain in the DOM
- xpra patches (`browser/xpra-patches.js`) are served as a standalone JS file from the web root, wrapped in `try/catch` for graceful degradation if xpra updates change the API
- System status API auto-detects the discrete GPU by picking the card with the most VRAM. CPU temp from `k10temp` (hwmon), GPU temp from `amdgpu` edge sensor (hwmon). During heavy GPU compute, the driver locks sysfs files (`EBUSY`); util/temp/power then fall back to parsing `/sys/kernel/debug/dri/N/amdgpu_pm_info` ("GPU Load", "GPU Temperature", "W (average SoC|GPU)") so the numbers stay populated. The manager runs as root, which is required for debugfs (0700)
- Terminal manager API validates URLs for `/api/browser/open` by rejecting shell metacharacters to prevent command injection
- Terminal instances are dynamic (on-demand via `/api/terminals/`). Systemd template units are not pre-enabled; the manager API starts/stops them. Only `claude-web-manager.service` is enabled at boot
- **Moving/renaming the repo directory requires re-rendering the 3 systemd units' `@APP_DIR@` AND restarting `claude-web-ttyd@N`.** `ttyd-run.sh` bakes the absolute `claude-session` path into ttyd's per-connection spawn command (`${SCRIPT_DIR}/claude-session attach N`) at ttyd start time, so a running ttyd keeps spawning the *old* path on every fresh WebSocket connect — which fails instantly and shows as a terminal that flashes "connected" in a reconnect loop (existing connections survive because their attach client was already spawned). The `claude-session serve` daemons are path-independent at runtime — they `execv('/bin/bash')` for shells and serve `/tmp/claude-session-N.sock` — so they keep working and must NOT be restarted (that would kill the live shells). So after a move: fix the units, `systemctl restart claude-web-ttyd@N` (sessions preserved), and restart `claude-web-manager` (its `REPO_DIR` is computed from its own script path)
- The `window.open` override in terminal pages intercepts xterm.js link clicks by returning a proxy object with a setter on `.location.href` — this matches xterm.js's pattern of `window.open()` then `obj.location.href = url`
- nginx uses a `map $uri $term_port` directive (generated for 1..50) and one regex location block instead of per-instance location blocks
- FileBrowser config is in `~/.config/filebrowser/filebrowser.db` (set via `filebrowser config set`), not CLI flags
- FileBrowser patches (`landing/filebrowser-patches.js`) are loaded via nginx `sub_filter` injection, not bundled with FileBrowser. The patches hide Vue's conditional action buttons and replace them with permanent always-visible buttons — CSS for these must be scoped to `.fb-permanent` to avoid overriding the `display:none` hiding of Vue's buttons. On desktop widths (>736px), `#dropdown` content renders inline in the header (not as a popup), so dropdown buttons also need label styling
- `landing/install.sh` must run without `sudo` — with `sudo`, `$HOME` resolves to `/root/` and files deploy to the wrong directory
- tunnel's `install.sh` only installs the `cloudflared` binary — tunnel creation and Access setup are interactive (see `tunnel/README.md`)
- xpra is single-client by default — without `--sharing=yes`, opening the Browser tab on a second device evicts the first, and a desktop+phone pair kick each other in a loop so the phone "never loads." Cloudflare-tunnel clients arrive from `127.0.0.1`, so in xpra logs a remote tunnel client appears as a loopback address (not the real client IP)
- xpra's HTML5 client assets are served `no-store` and uncompressed; the `/browser/` nginx snippet adds a regex asset location that caches + gzips them. nginx won't gzip proxied responses without `gzip_proxied any`, and xpra's JS Content-Type is `text/javascript` (not `application/javascript`) — both must be set or compression silently no-ops
- Desktop iframes get their `src` set on first activation (`loadIfNeeded`), not at iframe-creation time. ttyd inside an iframe whose ancestor is `display:none` initialises xterm.js with a 0×0 viewport, leading to truncated history that only a refresh fixes; deferring the `src` lets the inner content measure the real viewport on the first paint
- `/api/upload` uses a hand-rolled streaming multipart parser (`_BoundaryReader` + `_iter_multipart_files`). Reads from `self.rfile` are capped by `_LimitedReader(rfile, Content-Length)` because once the body is exhausted, a bare `rfile.read(n)` blocks forever on a keep-alive socket waiting for n more bytes
- iOS pinch-zoom is page-wide and irreversibly sticky once activated, so the desktop shell's viewport meta uses `user-scalable=no,maximum-scale=1`; per-app zooming (xpra canvas, FileBrowser UI) is the inner app's responsibility. Each app's iframe handles its own scroll on `100svh` body so the taskbar stays in the always-visible viewport region
- xpra's HTML5 client renders its own window chrome (`.windowhead`/`.window-title`/`.title-bar`) where the WM name ("matchbox") would otherwise be visible — these selectors are added to the CSS hide list in the `/browser/` nginx sub_filter
